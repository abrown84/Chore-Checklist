## How Parent Approval Works

### 1. Redemption Request Flow
```
Kid/Teen submits redemption request
         ‚Üì
   Parent receives notification
         ‚Üì
   Parent reviews request
         ‚Üì
Parent approves or rejects request
         ‚Üì
   Points processed if approved
```

### 2. Parent Dashboard
Parents see a dedicated "Parent Controls" section that shows:
- Pending redemption requests from their kids
- Request details (points, cash amount, date)
- Approve/Reject buttons for each request
- History of all processed requests

### 3. Kid/Teen Experience
- Kids and teens can submit redemption requests normally
- They see a clear message that parent approval is required
- They can track the status of their requests
- They receive feedback when requests are processed

## Implementation Details

### Role Permissions
Each role has specific permissions defined in `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`:

```typescript
export interface RolePermissions {
  canApproveRedemptions: boolean
  canManageHousehold: boolean
  canInviteMembers: boolean
  canManageChores: boolean
  canViewAllStats: boolean
  requiresApproval: boolean
}
```

### User Interface Updates
- **PointRedemption Component**: Now shows role-based approval panels
- **HouseholdManager Component**: Updated to handle new roles and permissions
- **Role-based Icons**: Visual indicators for different roles
- **Permission Checks**: UI elements show/hide based on user permissions

### Demo Users
The demo mode includes sample users with different roles:
- **Alex**: Parent (can approve redemptions)
- **Janice**: Parent (can approve redemptions)
- **Jordan**: Teen (requires approval, linked to Alex)
- **Avery**: Kid (requires approval, linked to Janice)

## Testing the System

### 1. Switch Between Roles
Use the "Promote to Parent" button in the debug section to test different roles.

### 2. Create Test Redemption Requests
Use the "Create Test Request" button to simulate redemption requests from different user types.

### 3. Test Approval Flow
1. Switch to a teen/kid role
2. Submit a redemption request
3. Switch to a parent role
4. Approve/reject the request
5. Verify the points are processed correctly

## Benefits
